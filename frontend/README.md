### SignIn Logic

1. **Enter Password and Email**
   - The user inputs their email and password into the provided fields.

2. **Attempt Sign-In with `signInWithEmailAndPassword`**
   - The credentials are used to authenticate with Firebase, which returns an ID token if the authentication is successful.

3. **Use ID Token to Sign in via NextAuth**
   - If the user is authenticated, the ID token is passed to `signInByNextAuth` to initiate a session with NextAuth.

4. **NextAuth Verifies the ID Token**
   - NextAuth uses its authentication API to verify the ID token provided by Firebase.

5. **User Data Returned to JWT and Session**
   - Upon successful verification, NextAuth returns the user data, which is stored in both the JWT (JSON Web Token) and the session.

6. **Fetch User Data with `useSession`**
   - The `useSession` hook can then be used to fetch the authenticated user's data within your application.
